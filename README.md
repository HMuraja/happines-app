# ABOUT SUBMISSION
## Intro
Welcome to Happiness Unleashed! In a busy world where everyone's got a lot on their plate, being kind can sometimes get lost in the shuffle. That's where the Happiness Unleashed stands out as a guiding light. It's easy to feel overwhelmed by the demands of our schedules or the complexities of the world around us, but kindness has the power to break through these barriers.

Picture this: in a world where everyone is rushing to meet deadlines, fulfill obligations, and chase success, a single act of kindness can make someone's day better. Whether it's a genuine smile, a helping hand, or a nice gesture, these small acts can uplift spirits, foster connection, and create ripple effects of positivity.

We wanted to allow our users to spread a sense of happiness by using our happiness-unleashed challenges that inspire others to pay it forward. Imagine the happiness you feel after making someone smile, knowing you've made a difference, and the happiness that comes from spreading kindness. Let's challenge ourselves to break free from the busyness and self-absorption of modern life.

Together, we can make the world a brighter, happier place where each of us has the power to unleash waves of happiness and countless smiles.

## Structure:
The site's structure is visually represented within the navigation bar. It encompasses various sections, starting with the "Home" landing page, which actively encourages user engagement by proposing four distinct acts of kindness.

Within the "Posts" section, users can view posts to sustain their motivation. The "Our Team" segment showcases the developer team behind the platform. In the "About" section, users find a detailed explanation of the application's purpose and the developers' underlying motivations.

Lastly, the "Account" section facilitates user authentication, providing options for logging in or signing up. Once authenticated, users gain access to a personalized view, where they can track their own completed acts of kindness.
