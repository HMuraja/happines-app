# ABOUT SUBMISSION
## Intro
Welcome to Happiness Unleashed! In a busy world where everyone's got a lot on their plate, being kind can sometimes get lost in the shuffle. That's where the Happiness Unleashed stands out as a guiding light. It's easy to feel overwhelmed by the demands of our schedules or the complexities of the world around us, but kindness has the power to break through these barriers.

Picture this: in a world where everyone is rushing to meet deadlines, fulfill obligations, and chase success, a single act of kindness can make someone's day better. Whether it's a genuine smile, a helping hand, or a nice gesture, these small acts can uplift spirits, foster connection, and create ripple effects of positivity.

We wanted to allow our users to spread a sense of happiness by using our happiness-unleashed challenges that inspire others to pay it forward. Imagine the happiness you feel after making someone smile, knowing you've made a difference, and the happiness that comes from spreading kindness. Let's challenge ourselves to break free from the busyness and self-absorption of modern life.

Together, we can make the world a brighter, happier place where each of us has the power to unleash waves of happiness and countless smiles. 

## Goal
Our app aims to make kindness a daily habit by offering simple challenges that inspire users to turn their good intentions into actions.

- ➡️ Problem: In a world where kindness is plentiful but easily overlooked in the chaos of everyday life, our app provides a platform for users to share their acts of kindness, sparking a chain reaction of positivity.
- ➡️ Objective: With this application, we aim to encourage a culture of kindness that extends beyond individual acts. We want these acts of kindness to become a natural part of people's lives, enriching their day-to-day experiences. By promoting kindness, we believe that people will not only feel happier but also cherish the moments when they are able to make a positive impact on others.
- ➡️ Target Audience:Our target audience includes individuals who value kindness and want to incorporate more of it into their daily lives and who also believes in the power of small acts of kindness to make a difference in the world. Our audience may also include those who are interested in personal development and self-improvement, as practicing kindness can have a positive impact on mental and emotional well-being.
- ➡️ Benefits: By promoting kindness, our app can create a more compassionate and connected community, where individuals feel happier and more fulfilled.
