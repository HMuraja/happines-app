## Structure:
The site's structure is visually represented within the navigation bar. It encompasses various sections, starting with the "Home" landing page, which actively encourages user engagement by proposing four distinct acts of kindness.

Within the "Posts" section, users can view posts to sustain their motivation. The "Our Team" segment showcases the developer team behind the platform. In the "About" section, users find a detailed explanation of the application's purpose and the developers' underlying motivations.

Lastly, the "Account" section facilitates user authentication, providing options for logging in or signing up. Once authenticated, users gain access to a personalized view, where they can track their own completed acts of kindness.
